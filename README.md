# 1. What is Java?
Java is a high-level, object-oriented, class-based programming language developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle). It is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.

## 2.Data Types and Variables
Primitive Types: int, float, char, boolean, etc.  
Reference Types: Objects, Arrays.  
Variables: Hold data; must be declared with a type.

## 3.Operators
Arithmetic: +, -, *, /  
Relational: ==, !=, <, >  
Logical: &&, ||, !  

## 4.Control Statements
If, else, switch: Decision-making.  
Loops: for, while, do-while for repetition.  

## 5. Arrays
Used to store multiple values of the same type  

## 6.OOP Concepts (Core of Java)
Class & Object: Blueprint and instance.  
Inheritance: One class acquires the properties of another.  
Encapsulation: Hiding data using access modifiers.  
Polymorphism: Many forms â€“ method overloading & overriding.  
Abstraction: Hiding implementation details.  

## 7.Methods
A block of code that performs a task.  
Can return a value or be void  

## 8.Constructors
Special methods to initialize objects.  
No return type and same name as the class.  

## 9. Access Modifiers
Control visibility: public, private, protected, default.

##  10. Exception Handling
Deals with runtime errors using try, catch, finally, throw, throws.

##  11. Java Packages
Groups related to classes.  
Use import to access them.  

##  12. Java Collections Framework
Includes List, Set, Map, etc.  
Used for data storage and manipulation.
